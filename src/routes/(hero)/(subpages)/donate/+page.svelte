			Unlike tax supported public libraries, we receive no funds from Federal, State, or local
			governments. Our funding comes from membership fees, donations, book rentals, the sale of used
			books and engraved bricks. Because we are a Section 501 (c) (3) organization, all donations
			are tax-deductible.

		<h2>Buy a Brick Program</h2>
		<p>
			The Buy a Brick Program is a means of raising funds to support the library. The bricks border
			the entry to the library. In addition to supporting the library by having bricks engraved with
			their own names, our donors have had bricks engraved with the names of their grandchildren, to
			commemorate the passing of a loved one or to honor a friend.
		</p>
		<p>
			Brick donations are $200 each. All contributions are tax-deductible as the library is a
			not-for-profit organization. Brick donor forms are available at the library front desk. Checks
			should be made payable to The Village Library.
